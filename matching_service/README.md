# Matching Service Specifications
> M2: Matching Service â€“ responsible for matching users based on some reasonable criteria (e.g., topics and difficulty level of questions, proficiency level of the users, etc.) This service can potentially be developed by offering multiple matching criteria.

The matching service is responsible for matching users based on the below defined criteria:
1. Topic selection (multiselect)
1. Difficulty selection (multiselect): Easy, Medium, Hard (or as defined by Question Service)
1. Language preference (One primary language, *up to* two secondary language)
1. Proficiency level (within +-10%) - to be implemented

## Matching Service API Endpoints
### WebSockets for Informing User Matched
- `ws /api/ws` - Connects to matching service websocket. To be used **before** calling `POST /api/match`.
    - Input: `user_id: str`
    - `ws://localhost:8001/api/ws?user_id=${userId}`
    - Message:
    ```json
        {
            "status": "success" | "timeout" | "relax",
            "matched_user_id": "3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa5" | None,
            "criteria": {
                "topic": "string",
                "difficulty": "string",
                "langugage": "string"
            } | None
        }
    ```
    - Message format: matched_user_id and criteria will be None for all statuses except success.
    - Statuses:
        - Success: Matching success. Matched user_id and criteria is given.
        - Timeout: 60s passed, user matching time out and user removed from queue.
        - Relax: 30s passed, language matching has been relaxed, secondary language will be used.

### Basic matching
- `POST /api/match` - Adds the user to the matching queue with the given criteria
    - Used by: Frontend - Matching page
    - Pre-condition: A websocket with the same user id has to be connected and ready before calling this method
    - Input: (as request body)
        ```json
        {
            "user_id": "3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa5",
            "criteria": {
                "topics": [
                "string"
                ],
                "difficulty": [
                "string"
                ],
                "primary_lang": "string",
                "secondary_lang": [],
                "proficiency": 0
            }
            }
        ```
    - Response:
        - `202 Accepted`: User successfully requested to be added into queue
        - `422 Validation Error`: Invalid/Malformed input
        - `409 Conflict`: User already in queue
    - Returns: "User xxx joined queue"/"User xxx already in queue"
    - Possible pushed events: See WebSockets section
- `DELETE /api/match` - Removes the user from the matching queue
    - Used by: Frontend - Finding match page - Cancel button
    - Input:
        - `user_id: UUID`
    - Response:
        - `200 OK`: User successfully removed from queue
        - `404 Not Found`: User not in queue
### Lobby feature
- `GET /api/lobbies` - Retrieves available matching lobbies
    - Used by: Frontend - Finding match page
    - Input: None
    - Response:
        - `200 OK` - Returns list of lobbies
        - `400 Bad Request` - Invalid/Malformed input
    - Output/Response body:
        ```python
        {
            lobbies: [
                {
                    lobby_id: UUID,
                    topic: list[Topic],
                    difficulty: list[Difficulty],
                    primary_lang: Language | None,
                    secondary_lang: list[Language],
                    time_remaining: int # in seconds
                },
                ...
            ]
        }
